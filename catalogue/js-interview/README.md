**Edit:**

* Having been in around fifty 60-to-90-minute JavaScript-related tech interviews, **every single day** for a month (yeah I'm doing the math right, I had triple interviews on certain days, double interview in others -- dunno how many brain cells I've lost in the meantime : ).
* And having reached to an offer level from 3 of those firms that I interviewed
**in 10 days** (it's a miracle, when you consider the hiring process may
take up to several months), 
* And having accepted an offer with a generous
amount of options and with a salary approaching the market median...

I can say, with a certain level of confidence, that companies that are worth
working for do not ask "how do you sort a red-black tree" kind of questions,
they rather focus on use cases that'll have an actual value in your 
day-to-day work life, such as...

* closures (a must!)
* Array.prototype, String.prototype functions
* relatively new stuff (css3 selectors, querySelectorAll)
* performance-related questions (edit DOM offline, string concatenation using an array buffer)
* functional programming,
* prototypal intheritance,
* memoization, mapreduce,
* and more of other fun stuff,
* and they'll give you **an actual project** to work with if they see you as a "strong candidate".

That is they don't play a game where the rules are created to generate a "virtual reality"
to "keep people out". Per contra, they try to do their best to get to know you, both technically
and behaviorally/culturally before they give their decision.

And in my honest opinion, that's the proper approach to take.

Actully I've been asked **mostly** what I mentioned 
[in this **o2.js** blog post](http://o2js.com/2011/04/23/do-you-think-you-know-javascript-you-dont/),
If you're serious about getting a decent **JavaScript Engineering** job
that you'll love to go to every single day of the week, doing amazing thing with genius minds,
then you had better review that link, before studying **booring** CS101-ish interview questions.

Don't get me wrong though, there still are companies that ask about **why manhole covers are round**,
or **how you can balance a binary tree**. So **do study** those **boring** stuf, just to increase the odds.
Besides, if you do not **memorize** but **actually** study those sh\*t, chances are that you'll learn a lot
from those questions as well, at least as an exercise **;)**.

This repository contains a growing list of JavaScript Job interview questions 
and related resources.

Currently, it may look more like "Interview Questions in JavaScript" rather 
than "JavaScript" Interview Questions. I mean the emphasis is on the interview,
rather than on JavaScript, so to speak. However, I will be adding more 
domain-specific JS/DOM/CSS3/HTML5 questions once I cover the basics, such as 
algorithms, linked lists, stacks etc -- which appear in job interviews
regardless of your domain of expertise.

I use nodejs to run examples. However any decent browser should equally work.
